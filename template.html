            <h5 class="mb-1">Slow down and relax</h5>
            Being calm and having a clear mind is very important. This will give
            you time to think and act properly. One easy way to do this is to
            take a shower or bath which cleanses you physically as well as
            mentally Also remember to hydrate yourself and drink lots of water.
            Meditation is another way to relax yourself and create a clam mind
            to think.

            <h5 class="mb-1">Talk to someone and let it all out</h5>
            Sometimes you need an outsider's perspective to see your situation
            clearly, so talking to a trusted friend or therapist would help you
            relieve stress or anxiety.

            At the end of the day your health wealth and well is what it all
            matters. Make sure you eat healthy, drink healthy because your body
            needs to function non stop so it requires the most care. A common
            problem faced during stress is lack of sleep or unbalanced sleep
            schedule which has to be changed and you must make sure you sleep at
            least 8 hours a day It says that any action that you continuously do
            for 21 days turn out to be a habit so set yourself a proper routine
            and work your best to maintain.

            Stress is an inevitable factor; the real question is how you deals
            with it. The main phase where you surrender yourself to stress and
            anxiety is when you overthink especially about future which is
            uncertain. So, when you are starting to feel stressed instead of
            staying in bed try to free you mind by actively involving in
            activities Workouts are a great option that helps you in many ways
            Try out simple stretches and movements that do help your entire
            body.Involve in activities that you like travelling, dancing, art
            etc
